# Diabetes Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether individuals are diabetic or not based on their features. Before developing the model, necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps were performed.
# Business Problem
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a person has diabetes or not. The model will be based on various features such as age, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc. The model can be used by healthcare providers to identify patients who are at high risk of developing diabetes and take necessary preventive measures.
# Story of Dataset
The dataset used in this project is part of a large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases in the United States. The data was collected for a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, Arizona. The dataset consists of various features such as age, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc. The target variable is specified as "outcome" and indicates whether the diabetes test result is positive (1) or negative (0).
# Data Analysis
Various data analysis techniques were used to understand the data and gain insights into the relationships between different features. The data was visualized using various graphs and charts to identify any trends or patterns. Correlation analysis was also performed to identify the features that have the strongest correlation with the target variable.
# Feature Engineering
Feature engineering was performed to select the most important features for the machine learning model. Various techniques such as scaling, normalization, and one-hot encoding were used to preprocess the data before feeding it into the machine learning model.
# Conclusion
In this project, a machine learning model was developed to predict whether individuals are diabetic or not based on their features. The model can be used by healthcare providers to identify patients who are at high risk of developing diabetes and take necessary preventive measures. Various data analysis and feature engineering techniques were used to preprocess the data before feeding it into the machine learning model. The model with the highest accuracy was selected for deployment.
